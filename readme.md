# Of Course

Output a string repeatedly until killed.

Yet Another
[`yes`](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/usr.bin/yes/yes.c) clone but
in Rust.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install ofCourse
```

Or use a binary from
[releases](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/ofCourse/releases/latest).

## Usage

Just like [`yes`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Unix)):

```sh
ofCourse
```

This will print "y" until the process is canceled.

You can also pass a custom string to repeat:

```sh
ofCourse custom string
```

It will print "custom string" until the process is canceled.
